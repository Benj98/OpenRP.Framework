## General Information
### üîπ What is OpenRP.Framework?  
OpenRP.Framework is the **open-source backbone** of Open Roleplay, containing most of the gameplay functionalities that make the server tick. While some unique features - such as the **biome generator** - remain closed-source, this library is designed to be a **powerful, community-driven** foundation for our roleplay server on Open Multiplayer.  

Open Roleplay itself is split into two projects:  
- **OpenRP.Core** - The closed-source part of the gamemode, containing server-specific logic and proprietary features.  
- **OpenRP.Framework** - The open-source library that powers most of the game mechanics, designed to be modular.  

### üé≠ What is Roleplay?  
Roleplay is about **stepping into a character and shaping stories through player-driven interactions**. Open Roleplay takes this concept further with **immersive mechanics, unique player-led factions, and dynamic world systems**, cutting out unnecessary bureaucracy while keeping realism and structure in place.  

### üöÄ The Vision  
The goal of Open Roleplay is to **break away from outdated roleplay formulas** and introduce **fresh, ambitious features** that feel like they could‚Äôve been made by Rockstar, if they cared about their community rather than just selling Shark Cards.  

Russian roleplay servers have been pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible for years. Open Roleplay takes inspiration from that approach, aiming to bring **highly detailed, feature-rich** roleplay to the English-speaking community while ensuring everything remains **polished, immersive, and grounded in realism**.  

The philosophy is simple:  
- No **excessive bureaucracy:** If you have a roleplay idea that makes sense, you can make it happen if you are willing to put in effort and dedication. Our admin team will advise you on how to make it happen if you ask for help.
- No **stagnation:** This isn't just another copy-paste server. Every system is designed to **innovate** and **break the game, only to make the impossible, possible**!
- **Nothing is impossible:** If an idea is **realistic, fits the time period, and aligns with the lore of our world**, then it‚Äôs possible. It just takes some work to make it happen!
- **A world shaped by its players:** Open Roleplay isn‚Äôt just a server. It‚Äôs a living world shaped by you, both IC and OOC. The direction of the server isn‚Äôt dictated from the top down but the community helps to decide the direction we go in.

### üåç The Open Philosophy  
The **"Open"** in Open Roleplay isn‚Äôt just a name but it reflects the way the project is run:  
- **Transparent Development:** A large portion of the framework is open-source and open for contributions.  
- **Freedom to Build:** No red tape stopping you from making things happen. If an idea is **realistic, fits the time period, and aligns with the lore of our world**, then you can make it happen if you are willing to put in effort and dedication.
- **Community-Driven:** OpenRP.Framework is built to evolve with its contributors, shaping the ultimate roleplay experience. The community helps to decide the direction we go in, both IC and OOC.

### üõ† Open Source, Not Copy-Paste  
This framework isn‚Äôt meant to be a plug-and-play gamemode for copycats. It‚Äôs **a foundation for the community to help build the best possible roleplay server together**.  

OpenRP.Framework is released under the **LGPL-3.0 license**, meaning:  
- **Contributions are welcome:** If you make improvements, give back to the community.  
- **Credits must remain intact:** Don‚Äôt strip out acknowledgments.
- **Respect the license:** Modifications are allowed, but keep things fair.

Read into the **LGPL-3.0 license** if you wish to use the framework or its code.

### üöÄ Get Involved  
OpenRP.Framework is a **community-driven project**, and contributions are encouraged. Whether you're a **developer, designer, or just passionate about roleplay**, you can help shape the future of the framework. Fork the project, submit pull requests, or join discussions to be part of something bigger.
